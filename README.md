# Scholion 🦝✨

**A private, local-first workspace for recorded evidence.**

Scholion turns audio and video into reproducible canonical transcripts, preserves source and processing provenance, lets people search a private corpus and navigate results back to exact verified evidence, and keeps notes, tags, collections, speaker labels, and saved research questions as durable user-owned knowledge.

Transcription is the engine room, not the whole product. Scholion also inspects the machine, chooses a safe local execution strategy, manages model custody, survives interrupted work, keeps word-level timing and anonymous-speaker evidence, publishes portable transcript views, incrementally reconciles an evolving library, plays verified local source evidence, and gives deletion the same explicit custody rules as creation.

Canonical transcript JSON is authoritative transcript evidence. Human-authored research state is authoritative user knowledge. DuckDB search/research projections and publication formats are rebuildable. The original recording is read-only throughout normal processing and can only be deleted through a separate explicit provenance-checked operation.

> **Scholion's product rule:** do complicated work locally, keep the evidence understandable, portable, and owned by the user.

## Why Scholion?

A *scholion* is an explanatory, critical, or interpretive note attached to a text; the plural is *scholia*. The name matches the product's evidence model: the recording and canonical transcript remain the source evidence, while human notes, labels, collections, and saved research questions accumulate around verified passages without replacing the source. See **[Product identity](docs/product-identity.md)** for the canonical naming contract.

Start with **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** for human-facing documentation or **[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)** for the shortest clone-to-transcript path. The desktop also keeps contextual help available inside the app so ordinary use does not depend on having repository docs open.

## What can it do right now?

Scholion is pre-production, but the backend and desktop cover a coherent path from importing a recording through local processing, evidence search, durable research, transcript/speaker management, verified local playback, custody-aware storage management, and explicit privacy-preserving update checks.

| Quality | Linux/macOS/Windows CI, strict typing, lint/format/security, complexity/dead-code, branch coverage, dependency audit, Playwright/axe, native Rust tests, package verification, targeted mutation qualification |

Model trust has two deliberately separate concepts. Provider/local custody proves what Scholion downloaded and currently observes. Project policy trust proves that the exact repository revision and complete file set match a catalog deliberately approved by the Scholion release. The policy machinery is implemented; the repository intentionally contains no guessed production faster-whisper entries. See **[Signed update and model trust channel](docs/security/update-model-trust.md)** and **[Production trust inputs](docs/security/production-trust-inputs.md)**.

Packaged Windows/macOS preview qualification now owns its FFmpeg/FFprobe dependency rather than trusting ambient host PATH. The managed media-tool inputs are reviewed, exact-byte identity is recorded in release evidence, and frozen Scholion resolves only the bundled `media-tools` directory. This removes a major package-reproducibility ambiguity without pretending the media parser is OS-sandboxed.

## From recording to useful evidence

![From recording to useful evidence diagram](./docs/diagrams/generated/recording-to-useful-evidence.svg)

[Diagram source (Mermaid)](./docs/diagrams/src/recording-to-useful-evidence.mmd)

Text fallback: source media is inspected and transcribed locally into canonical JSON; rebuildable search finds passages; canonical verification turns results back into evidence; durable human research attaches to that evidence; custody planning keeps destructive work explicit.

Search ranking is not source truth. A result points back to canonical transcript coordinates, and navigation verifies that generation before presenting precise evidence or accepting a durable note anchor.

## Desktop status

The Tauri + React desktop currently provides:

- native file/folder selection and remembered-location permissions;
- recording discovery without automatic processing side effects;
- a Processing Center for readiness, model state, job state, preflight, explicit embedded-audio-track confirmation, launch, cancel, resume/retry distinction, and private-state discard;
- Library search across transcripts, notes, tags, and collections;
- verified evidence context and source-relative cursor coordinates;
- generation/source-verified local audio/video playback from that evidence cursor without exposing source paths to React;
- Research note create/edit/delete, tag/collection navigation, saved-search lifecycle, typed retrieval controls, exact-generation evidence return, and explicit anchor review;
- transcript details/provenance, generation-safe speaker-name management, explicit speaker-overlap presentation, and post-hoc derived publication;
- a Storage workspace for backend-planned transcript custody changes, explicit source protection, and previewed old-processing cleanup;
- an Updates workspace with explicit Off / Never checked / Checking / Up to date / Trusted update available / Staging / Staged / Failure states;
- persistent **How this screen works** and **How Scholion works** guidance plus contextual Evidence/Playback/Transcript/multi-track/Storage/Updates explanations;
- eight accessible presentation skins through one compact theme picker; and
- persisted presentation preference without mixing theme state into evidence or research.

The browser/webview does **not** receive canonical/source filesystem paths for evidence navigation, transcript tools, playback, or lifecycle plans. It also does not choose update URLs, headers, artifacts, installer commands, or trust keys. Rust owns native desktop capability and opened media sessions; Python owns application/evidence/custody/media-selection/update policy; React owns presentation and explicit user intent.

When a file contains several embedded audio streams, Python reports that explicit confirmation is required. The desktop shows bounded source-declared title/language/default metadata when available, accepts the user's stream choice, and sends only that exact index back to Python for a fresh preflight. Start remains disabled until the backend returns a plan bound to that stream. Canonical provenance records the exact stream index and resume restores it. See **[Audio tracks](docs/audio-tracks.md)**.

Transcript tools are generation-bound. A long-lived UI cannot silently rename a speaker in a newer transcript generation: every inspect/mutation/publication request carries the exact canonical SHA-256 the user opened, and Python rejects stale identity. See **[Transcript and speaker tools](docs/transcript-tools.md)**.

Playback follows the same evidence discipline. Python re-verifies the exact canonical generation, original source bytes, bounded coordinate, and audio-stream identity; Rust then turns the approved source into an opaque local media session. Multi-track transcription is supported, but multi-track playback currently fails closed because the system WebView cannot yet prove it rendered the same embedded stream that produced the transcript. See **[Verified native playback](docs/native-playback.md)**.

Storage follows the same authority split. React requests a plan and renders the backend's effective scopes/actions; a separate fixed Tauri command can invoke only the custody bridge; Python recalculates the plan at execution and refuses stale confirmation tokens. Source and canonical paths are stripped before the response reaches React. See **[Storage and lifecycle controls](docs/storage-lifecycle.md)**.

Updates follow a similarly narrow boundary. React can request only status, check, or stage. The update endpoint and platform artifact remain application policy. Source/development builds without production verification material report **Update checking is off** and make no request. A manual check is network activity, not behavioral telemetry: GitHub/CDN can observe ordinary connection metadata such as IP address/time, but Scholion sends no installation ID, corpus/research content, hardware/model inventory, or product-behavior data. A staged artifact is not called installed until the later native signing/activation boundary can execute it safely.

In-app guidance is deliberately re-openable and non-hover-only where popovers are used. It explains contracts where users encounter them but carries no filesystem/database/process authority and does not recreate application policy in React. See **[In-app guidance](docs/in-app-guidance.md)**.

There are still no public signed installers or Releases. Source builds remain the supported user path. Hosted release engineering now constructs and qualifies exact unsigned Windows/macOS preview artifacts with managed runtime, deterministic provenance/lifecycle evidence, and repository-owned packaged FFmpeg/FFprobe, but those CI artifacts are not yet production-signed distributions or representative-device evidence.

## Themes and accessibility

Scholion ships **Archive, Midnight, Paper, Moss, Plum, Ember, Pride, and Monochrome**. They are not eight independent CSS systems. Every skin supplies the same semantic roles for background, surfaces, text, borders, accent/on-accent, controls, focus, errors, and selection.

Pride adds a decorative rainbow edge while leaving status meaning in text/structure. Monochrome is intentionally grayscale rather than another tinted dark theme. Every registered skin declares its native browser `color-scheme` and automatically enters the same Playwright WCAG-oriented contrast matrix and axe qualification.

Read **[Desktop themes and accessibility](docs/development/desktop-accessibility.md)** for the contract.

## Install the current source build

The supported development/source path uses Python 3.12 and Scholion's repository-local bootstrap. A system-wide `uv` installation is not required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raccoon-compile/Scholion.git
cd Scholion
python3.12 scripts/bootstrap_python.py
source .venv/bin/activate
scholion init
scholion doctor
```

On Windows, use `py -3.12 scripts\bootstrap_python.py`; activation is optional if you invoke `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` explicitly. See **[Project-local developer toolchain](docs/development/project-local-toolchain.md)** for the complete cross-platform contract and **[Desktop development prerequisites](docs/development/desktop-development.md)** for the native desktop.

## Plan, transcribe, and resume from the CLI

```bash
scholion models recommend
scholion models install small
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --dry-run
scholion transcribe interview.m4a
```

For a source with several embedded audio tracks, bind the exact FFmpeg stream index:

```bash
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3 --dry-run
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3
```

Add derived publication formats when useful:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --export txt --export srt --export vtt
```

Resume a validated interrupted job:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --resume JOB_ID
```

Model acquisition is explicit and network-bearing. Resume rechecks source identity and current resource admission rather than silently changing the execution contract, including its selected audio stream.

## Search, annotate, and name speakers

```bash
scholion library rebuild
scholion library search "housing insecurity"
scholion library find "housing insecurity" --context-segments 1
scholion library speakers list JOB_ID
scholion library speakers name JOB_ID speaker-02 "Dr. Chen"
scholion library speakers transcript JOB_ID
```

Speaker names are durable user-authored state. `speaker-02` remains anonymous machine-produced evidence; the human label is separate and generation-bound.

Research metadata can constrain retrieval, and saved searches persist the question rather than today's result snapshot. See **[Research search](docs/research-search.md)** and **[Research notes](docs/research-notes.md)**.

## Delete exactly what you mean

Deletion remains dry-run first from the CLI:

```bash
scholion library delete JOB_ID --scope library-view
```

The plan prints actions and a confirmation token. Nothing changes until the same request is repeated with that token. `canonical-transcript` does **not** imply `research-notes`, `saved-searches`, or `source-recording`.

The native desktop exposes the same contract under **Storage**: select explicit scopes, preview the backend-calculated plan, review any scope expansion/preservation consequences, then apply that exact plan. Source recording removal requires an additional acknowledgment and provenance check.

Age-based retention is narrower:

```bash
scholion library retention --execution-days 30
```

The Storage workspace can preview the same private-state cleanup and marks interrupted/failed candidates whose resume capability would be lost. Retention preserves canonical transcripts, human research, source media, and lightweight lifecycle manifests.

Read **[Storage and lifecycle controls](docs/storage-lifecycle.md)** and **[Safe deletion and retention](docs/architecture/safe-deletion-retention.md)** for the exact contract.

See **[Frontend testing strategy](docs/development/frontend-testing.md)** for frontend/backend test ownership.

## Where the project goes next

Research/search, Processing, explicit embedded-track transcription, desktop comprehension/themes, transcript/speaker tools, verified native playback, contextual guidance, desktop lifecycle/retention controls, architecture consolidation, product identity, application-side update/model-trust mechanics, package lifecycle/provenance, and managed packaged FFmpeg/FFprobe custody are complete MVP foundations.

The remaining first-release sequence is intentionally narrow:

1. **Production trust inputs:** review and bundle the real faster-whisper model-trust catalog, provision the approved public update-key set, and exact-pin/wire the native Ed25519 verifier;
2. **OS signing/notarization:** sign Windows package bytes and sign/notarize macOS package bytes after production trust inputs are stable;
3. **Native update activation:** execute only an already trusted, OS-signed staged candidate while keeping staging distinct from installation until this boundary is qualified;
4. **Representative release qualification:** prove real packaged CPU-only/accelerator/Apple/Windows behavior, offline/update/repair/lifecycle cases, accessibility/device behavior, and #114's remaining native task-transport evidence; and
5. **MVP release:** publish the final candidate with checksums, deterministic provenance, SBOM material, signatures, and qualification evidence bound to the same bytes.

Official Linux binary packaging remains blocked by #135. Backup/restore + research portability, packaged semantic-model custody, and freeform research notebook/memo features remain valuable **post-MVP** work. They are no longer being treated as reasons to postpone the first useful packaged Scholion build.

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the capability audit and sequencing.
